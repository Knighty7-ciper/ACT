Structure Plan (requested CRA-style mapping) â€” 2025-10-17
- We will mirror the requested hierarchy inside Next.js by creating feature folders under frontend/components and aliasing paths to resemble src/components/*, while keeping app/ routes intact.
- Steps:
  1) Create wrapper directories: components/Layout, Currency, Wallet, Transaction, User, Admin, UI, FAQ with index exports.
  2) Add CSS modules or co-located .css files matching requested names; preserve existing Tailwind/vars.
  3) Add path aliases so imports like src/components/Wallet/WalletCard resolve to frontend/components/Wallet/WalletCard.
  4) Do not create public/index.html (Next uses app/), but keep public/favicon.ico, manifest.json, robots.txt.
- This keeps Next conventions while matching your expected structure.

Env & Secrets Persistence
- All Supabase and Postgres keys from chat are set as environment variables (secure, not committed). They will persist and be used automatically.
- We will not commit secrets into .env in the repo for security; instead, provide .env.example with variable names only if needed.

TODOs created:
- Map CRA-style structure to Next without breaking routes
- Implement aliases + wrapper components
- Add CSS files preserving styles
- Update NEXT.TXT with plan (done)
- Stabilize Supabase redirects/cookies (in progress)
