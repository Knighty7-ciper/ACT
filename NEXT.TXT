AfriLink – Frontend Commit Review, Smoke Test & Landing Page (2025-10-16)

Commits after sync:
- 189191d Add generated frontend file structure tree for review

Changes:
- Fixed case-sensitive imports:
  - Renamed frontend/components/UI -> frontend/components/ui
  - Renamed frontend/components/Admin -> frontend/components/admin
  - Updated frontend/tsconfig.json paths: "@components/ui/*" -> "./components/ui/*"
- Installed frontend deps with pnpm and ran production build for smoke test.

Smoke test result:
- Next.js compiled successfully, but prerender failed on /404 with error: "<Html> should not be imported outside of pages/_document".
- Added TODO: Fix Next build error: Html used outside pages/_document during 404 prerender.

Landing page:
- app/page.tsx already implements a rich landing (hero, live ticker, stats, features, CTA). No further changes needed now.

Next actions:
- Investigate any accidental usage of next/document in app code or dependencies for 404 route; update to app-router compatible patterns.
- Proceed with deployment config updates to use frontend/ as Next root.
